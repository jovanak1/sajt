    <h1>Emu War</h1>
    
    <p>The Emu War, also known as the Great Emu War,[1] was a nuisance wildlife management military operation
      undertaken in Australia over the later part of 1932 to address public concern over the number of emus
      said to be running amok in the Campion district of Western Australia. The unsuccessful attempts to curb 
      the population of emus, a large flightless bird indigenous to Australia, employed soldiers armed with Lewis
      guns—leading the media to adopt the name "Emu War" when referring to the incident. While a number of the birds
      were killed, the emu population persisted and continued to cause crop destruction.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War">Read more</a>
